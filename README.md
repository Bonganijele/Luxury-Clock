To enable the AI Assistant, go to the settings and click the "Enable" button as the first step.

Once enabled, you can interact with the assistant by saying "Hi" or "Hello," and it will respond to you. If you want to explore more advanced features related to OpenAI technologies, you can use commands like ASK, QUESTION, INQUIRE, or phrases such as "Please, can I ask you something?"

If you want the assistant to stop responding, simply say Stop, Quit, or Exit.
